# Stations_near_glaciers
A quick Python code to find seismic stations near glaciers. This can be useful for various observational seismology projects such as monitoring icequakes and for ambient noise velocity changes.

The global station list has been downloaded from IRIS-Gmap (https://ds.iris.edu/gmap/) and saved as csv.
The location of the glaciers data has been downloaded from National Snow and Ice data center (https://nsidc.org/data/glacier_inventory/).
